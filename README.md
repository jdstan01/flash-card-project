# Flash Card Project
A flash card project that helps with learning a language. 

If you guessed the translation of the word correctly, hit the check mark. Else, hit the x mark. 

If nothing is done in 10 seconds, the translation of the word will automatically show. Words that are not guessed correctly should be hit with the x-mark. 

On the next run, the program will only show the words the user did not guess correctly prior to the current session.
